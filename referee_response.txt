General comments:

Overall this is a well-formulated, and well-presented research project.  It is very rare to see the noise mitigation or ``detchar'' community produce a physically motivated, mathematically sound, noise reduction technique *and* test its effectiveness on an actual astrophysical search pipeline.  One of those is always missing, usually the last one, the one that's most important.  I recommend this paper for publication, after the corrections below are made.

I would like to see all of the problems identified below corrected, but the most serious are (i) the repeated claims that glitches are ``non-Gaussian'', made here without supporting evidence, and (ii) the lack of a statement of the statistical significance of the final result, namely that glitch removal improves sensitivity.  Fixing both issues should be straight-forward.  Note that even in the event that upon analyzing their results they find their conclusion is not statistically significant, but I would *still* recommend publication, since even that observation should be documented.

1. References.  I thank the authors for providing preprint information for all papers.  it is time consuming for them, but it makes finding the documents much easier, especially when away from campus.  however, the information provided is simply the arxiv document number which is incomplete.  I recognize them to be arxiv document numbers, so I didn't have any problems, but they could easily have been codes in some other database.  for example reference [1] is said to be simply "Preprint 1411.4547", with no database or location specified.  this is found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4547 which states to cite it as "arXiv:1411.4547 [gr-qc]".  I recommend the authors follow the citation instructions provided by arxiv.

Change:
The relevant preprint references have been updated to the correct 'cite as:' information as displayed on arXiv.

2. Abtract, "... we demonstrate an increase in the sensitive volume of the gravitational wave search for binary black hole signals ..." --> "... we demonstrate an increase in the sensitive volume of a gravitational wave search for binary black hole signals ...".  Note:  the 6 day analysis described here is not any of "the" published searches for gravitational waves from binary black holes, it is merely intended to be a representative example of such a thing.

Change:
We agree, the text has been changed from "the" to "a" GW search.

3. Introduction, page 2, line 16.  as explained in reference [3] the first detection of gravitational waves was accomplished by the coherent waveburst pipeline.  this search pipeline is not included in the list of four example search pipelines that are cited.  since the discovery in reference [3] is specifically called out in this manuscript, I recommend adding a suitable reference for the search pipeline that achieved it.  I'm not familiar with which to recommend, perhaps there is information in the documentation, which a search engine led me to find at https://www.atlas.aei.uni-hannover.de/work/salemi/waveburst/doc/cwb/man/index.html.

Change:
The coherent waveburst pipeline reference, "https://inspirehep.net/literature/1802544", has been added for the burst search that found the first detection within 3 minutes of the gravitational wave event

Note: Two comments with regards to the referencing of glitches as non-Gaussian have been combined in this response.

4. Introduction, page 2, line 20.  the authors make the assertion that glitches are non-Gaussian.  has this been established?  clearly glitches are not the result of a stationary Gaussian process because their amplitudes are too great a departure from the mean, however has it been established that they are the result of a process that is *both* non-stationary *and* non-Gaussian?  said another way, has it been shown that a non-stationary, but still Gaussian, process cannot be constructed that adequately models glitch features in GW strain data?  references [13], [14], and [15] do not appear to support the claim of non-Gaussianity, but I have not read every sentence with care (it's nearly 200 pages of text, altogether, and the authors of this manuscript have not directed the reader to the appropriate location).  here's what my reading of those references found:

	- reference [13] on page 40 states "Over long stretches of LIGO-Virgo data, the noise is known to be non-stationary and non-Gaussian." but that claim is made without supporting documentation and without a supporting reference.  that text directs the reader to section 5 for supporting documentation, but section 5 is very careful never to claim the noise is non-Gaussian, only that it is non-stationary.  that claim of non-Gaussianity in reference [13] appears to be a fabrication, and cannot be used as supporting documentation for that same claim in this manuscript (perhaps that paper's referees were not as diligent as I am being).

	- reference [14] never makes the claim that the noise is non-Gaussian.  it does claim that a software system known as "iDQ" was used to search for and identify periods of time that are non-Gaussian, and that claim of non-Gaussianity is even in the title of the supporting reference for iDQ (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abab5f).  however, again, nowhere in that document is that claim justified other than to also cite this manuscript's reference [13], which as I have explained does not support that claim.  the authors of the iDQ paper appear to not be using the expression ``non-Gaussian'' as a well defined mathematical property of a stochastic process, but merely as a colloquial synonym for the generic term ``glitch'', perhaps because it makes it sound more science-y.  for example, just above their equation (5) they talk about formulating a "probability that Gaussian noise alone could have produced h", where what they mean to have said is "probability that stationary Gaussian noise alone could have produced h".  note above in their equation (1) where they have specified that n(t) is a *stationary* Gaussian noise process, a property that has been dropped from the analysis between there and equation (5) without explanation.  as I said, they appear to be using the expressions ``Gaussian'' and ``non-Gaussian'' as a synonyms for the generic terms ``non-glitch'' and ``glitch'', respectively, and are ignoring the mathematical meaning of the words.  in any case, there is nothing presented in that paper that establishes glitches to be non-Gaussian.

	- finally reference [15] does not contain any claim of non-Gaussianity.  like (most of) [13] it is careful only ever to differentiate between that which is both stationary and Gaussian, together, and that which is not, without saying which property, specifically, is not met.

without supporting documentation, the authors of this manuscript must reword this document to not make the claim that glitches are non-Gaussian.  the claim, specifically, should be that glitches are the result of a process that is not a stationary Gaussian process.

14. Also, here again in several places the authors are describing glitches as "non-Gaussianity".  the observation that the residuals are not consistent with the properties of the surrounding stationary Gaussian noise does not mean the glitch is the result of a non-Gaussian process, only that it's not the result of the same stationary Gaussian process that produced that other noise component.

Change:
We have avoided referring to glitches as non-Gaussianities:

Introduction:
"the data contains both non-stationary noise and non-Gaussian transient noise `glitches'."
to:
"the data contains both non-stationary noise and short duration `glitches' where noise power increases rapidly."

Section 3.4:
"This test is constructed so as to produce large values when the data contains a non-Gaussianity that is not well described by the template, but to follow a $\chi^2$ distribution if a non-Gaussianity that matches well to the template is present, or if no non-Gaussianity is present in the data."
to:
"This test is constructed so as to produce large values when the data contains a glitch, or astrophysical signal, that is not well described by the template, but to follow a $\chi^2$ distribution if a glitch that matches well to the template is present, or if the data is Gaussian and stationary."

Section 3.4, next paragraph:
"Any non-Gaussianity that does not exhibit symmetric morphology should not fit with this deconstruction of the template, and should result in elevated $\chi_{r}^{2}$ values."
to:
"Any glitch, or astrophysical signal, which does not exhibit symmetric morphology should not fit with this deconstruction of the template, and should result in elevated $\chi_{r}^{2}$ values."

Section 5:
"such techniques offer a method for mitigating the effect that these non-Gaussianities will have on the search, maximizing the number of observations that can be made."
to:
"such techniques offer a method for mitigating the effect that these glitches will have on the search, maximizing the number of observations that can be made."

5. Introduction, page 2 line 42, and page 3 line 43.  the authors have repeatedly used (what I feel to be) the awkward phrase "surfaces in which scattered-light glitches originate from".  I'm pretty sure this is wrong, I think you can't both "in" and "from" something with only a single verb.  you have to pick one, like, "surfaces from which scattered-light glitches originate".

Change:
We have revised the phrase to "surfaces from which scattered-light glitches originate," as suggested.

6. Section 2, page 7, line 23, the total amplitude when the main beam and scattered light beam combine is said to be "Atot = A0 + Asc", but that is not true.  that can only be true for special values of the phase between them, which from equation (2) is not required to be 0.  I think this would be more clear if the amplitudes and phases were not separated, but instead if the amplitudes were treated as complex numbers.  for example if (1) was written

	A_sc = A_0 T \sqrt{2F / pi} \sqrt{f_sc} exp(i phi_sc)

with phi_sc defined as in (2), then it would be true that A_tot = A_0 + A_sc, as written.  please either correct the statements or change the mathematical definitions of the quantities so the statements are correct.

Change:
We thank the reviewer for noticing this inconsistency and providing a solution which we have now implemented into the paper, changing equation (1) to include the exponential term. We edit the following two sentences to define phi_sc and smoothly follow into equation (2): 
"where $A_{0}$ is the amplitude of the light resonating in a Fabry–Pérot cavity and $f_{sc}$ is the fraction of the optical power scattered back into the main beam.

The phase angle modulated by the displacement of the scattering optics is also defined as (2)"

to

"where $A_{0}$ is the amplitude of the light resonating in a Fabry–Pérot cavity, $f_{sc}$ is the fraction of the optical power scattered back into the main beam and $\phi_{sc}$ is the phase angle modulated by the displacement of the scattering optics, defined as (2)"

-----
7. Section 2, page 7, line 26, the logic is backwards here.  the claim is the strain is proportional to the scattered light phase, and therefore we write equation (3).  but equation (3) is not a proportionality relationship.  for small changes in phase, sin(phi0 + delta phi) \approx cos(phi0)*sin(delta phi) which *is* a proportionality relationship between strain and phase, but you get to that conclusion from equation (3), not the other way around.  Please reword.

Change:
We have reworded the statement regarding the proportionality relationship between the strain and scattered-light phase. The text previously read "The measured gravitational wave strain is proportional to the phase noise and so the noise introduced by scattered-light, h_{sc}, can be expressed as" and now reads "The noise introduced by the scattered-light, h_{sc}, can be approximated through the relationship sin(phi0 + delta phi) \approx cos(phi0) \times sin(delta phi) for small delta phi, and can be expressed as".

9. Section 3, page 12, line 42, the claim "The matched filter is the optimal method for detecting known waveforms in the data, when the data is stationary and Gaussian" is incomplete, and for the purposes of this paper, it is false.  This false claim is widely repeated in the GW literature, and it needs to stop.  The matched filter inner product is the optimal detection statistic *in the Neyman-Pearson sense* when searching for *a single known waveform* at *a single known time* in stationary Gaussian noise.  when searching for any member of a family of waveforms --- as is being done here --- it is *not* the optimal detection statistic.  it is, nevertheless, widely used because it has such a low computational cost, and because it's hoped to be probably good enough given that in the other special case it is, in fact, optimal, but that's not the same as being actually optimal.  perhaps one can argue it's "optimal" in the "what I can be bothered doing because it's probably good enough" sense, but that's not what people will assume this claim means, and it's not what the authors intend them to infer when making the claim.  the statistic known to extremize the detection efficiency at fixed false-alarm rate (the Neyman-Pearson criterion) is the likelihood ratio

P(data | signal) / P(data | noise)

for a single known waveform at a single known time in stationary Gaussian noise it can be shown that this ratio is monotonic in the matched filter SNR defined as the normalized noise-weighted inner product in the manuscript's equation (18), and therefore thresholding on SNR in that case is as good as thresholding on the likelihood ratio --- it's optimal.  if the waveform is not known, but it's still known that only one member of the family is present at a time, then P(data | signal) becomes

P(data | signal) = \int_{waveform family} P(data | specific waveform) d waveform

i.e., you need to marginalize the numerator of the likelihood ratio over choice of waveform.  the assumption that the matched filter SNR maximized over a template bank is still probably good enough is equivalent to assuming that P(data | specific waveform) is a strongly peaked function at the correct waveform, and so the marginalization integral can be approximated up to an unknown (and irrelevant) normalization factor by the value of the integrand at its peak.  it's not optimal, it's an approximation of what would be, and it's probably not even a good approximation for low amplitude signals, but it leads to an algorithm that has a low computational cost, and that ends up winning the argument.

Change:
We agree with the reviewer that the initial statement that the matched filter isn't the optimal method for detecting waveforms and therefore we have been more explicit in why matched filtering was chosen for this research project, following precedent set by the gravitational wave searched historically and the good approximation that matched filtering is to the likelihood ratio calculation. Therefore, we have replaced the statement:

"The matched filter is the optimal method for detecting known waveforms in the data, when the data is stationary and Gaussian, and is defined as~\cite{findchirp}."

with the following paragraph:

"To identify glitches with these values of the parameterization, we follow the same technique as that commonly used to identify compact binary mergers and apply matched filtering. The matched filter is defined as~\cite{findchirp}."

10. Section 3.2, page 12, line 8, what is "search" referring to here?  this paragraph is describing the construction of a template bank via a stochastic algorithm that searches for and fills holes in a template bank.  *that* search is not linear in the number of templates.  that algorithm is probably cubic or worse in the final number of templates.  if what is meant is the search for glitches using the template bank is linear in the size of the bank, then please reword this to make that more clear.

Change:
To ensure the statement is more clear we have included explicit reference to searching for scattered-light glitches with matched filtering and at the end of the same paragraph we have included more information on how costly the template bank generation is in the entire search process.  The statement previously read:

"The dominant cost of the search is matched filtering and is approximately linear to the number of templates"

The change is as follows:

"The dominant cost of the search for scattered-light glitches is matched filtering and is approximately linear in the number of templates, a larger template bank will find all of the glitches with more accurate parameter values but the computational cost of the search will be increased. The template bank generation alone does not constitute a significant computational cost in the search."

11. section 3.2, page 12, line 24.  a match of 1.0 indicates *parallel* waveforms, not identical waveforms.  equation (22) defines match in terms of normalized versions of the waveforms, so the match does not imply anything about the magnitude of either of the waveforms (a and b can be scalled up or down without changing the match between them).

Change:
We explicitly define a match of 1.0 being found between identical ~normalized~ waveforms.
The sentence now reads: "The value for the match, $M$,  is bounded between 0 and 1, where a value of 0 indicates orthogonal waveforms and a value of 1 indicates identical normalized waveforms."

12. Figure 4.  if I zoom in enough, I can see that it's a scatter plot of black dots on a white background, but viewing from normal page reading distance I can't tell if it's that or white dots on a black background.  please explain which it is in the caption.

Change:
In an effort to make Figure 4 clearer for readers we have edited the caption to include "(black points)" when describing the templates to indicate that templates are represented by black points on a white background.

The figure caption now reads: "The template bank of scattered-light glitch templates (black points) used in the search for scattered-light glitches. The glitch frequency parameter values range from 20Hz - 80Hz and the time period parameter values range from 1.8s - 5.5s. This bank was created with a maximum match allowed between two templates of 0.97 and contains 117,481 templates."

13. Section 3.4, page 14, equation (23) seems to not be a \chi^2 distributed R.V.  the (2n - 2) factor in the denominator appears to be the # of degrees of freedom, so this looks like (\chi^2 / DOF), i.e. a R.V. whose expectation value in noise is 1.  my understanding of what this is is reinforced by the form of equation (24), where clearly 1 is a special value.  that's a sensible quantity to compute, but it's not a \chi^2 distributed R.V.  the expectation value of a \chi^2 distributed random variable is equal to the number of degrees of freedom.  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution.  maybe changing the variable to \bar{\chi}^{2} and changing (23) to

\bar{chi}^{2} = \frac{\chi^{2}}{\text{DOF}} = \frac{n}{2 n - 2} ...

but leaving all the rest of the text unchanged is fine.  it's clearly some kind of \chi^2 statistic, that's not false, so calling it that isn't wrong.  what I mean is one only needs to change the symbol when used in mathematics, as the quantity from equation (23), one doesn't need to change the symbol in the text when talking about a \chi^2 statistic.

Change:
We have included the suggested additional equation within equation (23) to emphasize the chi^2 value we are calculating (now denoted chi_r^2 in the equation) is normalized by the number of degrees of freedom. We have also updated occurrences of chi^{2} to the chi_{r}^{2} variable where the text is explicitly calling for that calculated quantity.
"\chi_{r}^{2} = \frac{\chi^{2}}{\textrm{DOF}} = \frac{n}{2n - 2} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{n}} - \rho_{bin,i}\right)^2."

16. Section 4.1, Table 2, page 26.  we need to know what change in recovered injection count we should expect just from random chance.  we need to know if these changes in sensivity are statistically significant or not.  for example, the actual number recovered is a binomial-distributed random variable.  I can't do the analysis properly with the information available, you will have the information needed to do this properly, I can only guess, but here's how to proceed.  6200 injections were placed in the data, some of which will be found, at random, to meet the criterion "missed or found when glitches are present, but found or missed (the opposite) when glitches are removed".  which injections meet this criterion are uniformly distributed among the injections, and whether any individual injection meets this criterion is independent of which other injections have or haven't met it.  therefore, the number of injections for which the "found/missed" answer changes when the glitches are moved is, like the count of recovered injections itself, also a binomial-distributed random variable.  the maximum likely estimate for the probability that an injection meets this criterion is the actual observed rate at which it happens.  I don't know how many injections changed their answer, I can only see from table 2 that the net change is +7.  that's the difference between the number of additional found and the number of additional missed injections, not the total that change state.  but using that number, the estimate for the probability an injection is affected by the glitch removal is p = 7/6200 = 0.113%.  the variance in the number that meet the criterion is n * p * (1-p) = 6.99, so there +7 observed increase in recovered injections has a 38% uncertainty.  The claim that the sensitivity has gone up at all is something like a 3 sigma result.

however!!  as I said, that number is incorrect because it's using only the net change as the count.  you need to look to see what total number of injections changed their state, and re-do the analysis above using that number.  the 38% I obtained above is a lower bound on the uncertainty, so "3 sigma" is an upper bound on the confidence.  the correct answer is worse than this.

Change:
We thank the reviewer for the effort they have made to highlight the statistical significance of our result and have provided the analysis they wish to see. The paper now contains the information concerning the number of injections that have changed state, either newly missed or newly found, these are displayed clearly in table 2, page 27, section 4.1 alongside an update caption:
"The number of injections found by each search with a false-alarm rate less than 2 per year alongside the number of newly-found and newly-missed injections, those by the glitch-subtracted and not the original search and vice versa. We also show the sensitivity ratio of the glitch-subtracted search and original search for each injection set."

With this information we have repeated the analysis made by the reviewer in their comment, the calculation has been included in Appendix A and the results of which - that the results we have found aren't statistically significant - have been included in section 4.1 alongside our opinion that the sensitivity gain isn't good enough to justify the use of time and resources on reducing the error in the computed sensitivity ratio.

The sentence added into section 5:
"The statistical significance of the sensitivity increase we report for the binary black hole injection set can be found by investigating the null hypothesis of seeing the same $1\%$ increase under the assumption that the subtraction of \scl{} glitches does not actually increase sensitivity. When performing this analysis we find that our result is not statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level (see~\ref{sec:apdx_stat_sig} for details) and could be explained by random chance however, the marginal sensitivity increase would not justify repeating the \scl{} glitch search and glitch-subtracted \gw{} search on a larger injection set, instead more work is needed to better identify and remove \scl{} glitches while remaining safe in the presence of \gw{} signals."

The statistical significance appendix calculation:
"We report a $1\%$ increase in the sensitivity for the binary black hole injection set in the glitch-subtracted \gw{} search (see section~\ref{sec:results}). We wish to determine the statistical significance of this results under the null hypothesis that subtracting \scl{} glitches prior to searching for \gws{} does not increase the sensitivity of the \gw{} search. The binary black hole injection set contains $6200$ injected signals, $10$ additional injections were found in the glitch-subtracted \gw{} search, $3$ additional injections were missed in our search, this gives us $13$ injections which have changed state.

First, we calculate the probability that an injection has been affected by the glitch removal, 
    p = \frac{13}{6200} = 0.21\% ,
then we calculate the standard deviation, 
    \textrm{std} = \sqrt{n * p * (1 - p)} = 3.60 .
Using the standard deviation we calculate the number of standard deviations our result deviates from the mean. We divide the number of positively changed (newly-found) injections by the standard deviation, 
    \textrm{standard deviations} = \frac{(10 - 3)}{3.60} = 1.94 .
Under the assumption of no sensitivity increase caused by the subtraction of glitches, we measure our result of +7 newly-found \gw{} injections to lie $1.94$ standard deviations from an expected value of $0$ newly-found injections. The critical value of a 95\% confidence interval, that is to say we are 95\% confidence that our null hypothesis is true, is $1.96$ meaning our result is within the 95\% confidence interval. We can describe this as there being a greater than 5\% chance that our result is not caused by the subtraction of glitches but is instead caused by random chance. While this is disappointing, the result is very close to the boundary. To reduce the error in the computed sensitivity ratio a larger injection set test would be required, this would need a large time and computational power investment which we do not believe is justified in the case of such a minor increase in the sensitivity. Instead we would devote our effort into developing new techniques and refining the process to better identify and remove \scl{} glitches while not removing \gw{} signals."

COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR(S)
The authors develop a chi-square discriminator for the scattered-light glitches in LIGO detectors and use it to test the improvement in performance of searches of compact binary coalescence signals. For this purpose they simulate those signals for varying source distances and compare the sensitivity volumes with and without the use of their method. They report observing very modest improvements and briefly discuss possible ways in which this method may be improved in the future. Scattered-light glitches are known to be a significant source of false-alarms in binary searches and have resulted in retractions of alerts.
For that reason, this work targets a worthy problem, which is expected to grow in its impact in the upcoming fourth observation run.
I recommend the work for publication provided the concerns below are addressed satisfactorily.

-----
Note: In the current version these are equations (23) & (24)
1. There is potential for ambiguity in the use of $\rho$ in equations (22) and (23). Is it true that the \rho in both equations is computed using the scattered-light template? If so, it would help to emphasize this aspect below (23), especially, because you cite a binary paper to motivate the construction of the reweighted SNR.

Change:
We agree that there is a potential for confusion, so the statement "where rho_{rw} represents the reweighted signal-to-noise ratio of the scattered-light glitch template calculated using the signal-to-noise ratio, rho, and the chi^2 value of that template." has been included after equation (24) to explicitly define the variables.

2. In Sec. 3.5, how was the choice of 0.9s for the clustering window made? Ditto for the glitch frequency window size of 4Hz.

Change:
We have updated both statements to include more information on how they were chosen.
"using a window of 0.9 seconds" -> "using a window of half of the shortest duration template - 0.9 seconds"
"using a window size of $4$Hz" -> "using a window size of $4$Hz, a lower limit on the frequency separation of harmonic glitches,"

3. Figure 6: Lowering the reweighted-SNR threshold from 8 would identify more scattered-light glitches, but would also misidentify some of the binary signals as glitches based on only the chi^2 and SNR values shown here. However, this reweighted-SNR is not the only discriminator available to the binary signals, some of which may well separate from these glitches by way of other chi^2 test. I presume those tests do not benefit these injections. If so, this point should be clarified here.

Change:
The reviewer is correct that discriminators made available to gravitational wave signals would not be applicable here due to the scattered-light subtraction happening prior to running any gravitational wave searches. The subtraction will interfere with the gravitational wave signal power before any discriminator can be applied to prevent the subtraction from occurring. This is a potential future development for this project. We have included this reasoning in the discussion on page 31:
"Selectively subtracting glitches based on the presence of a gravitational wave signal is possible by moving the glitch subtraction process inside of the gravitational wave searches and including the results of other gravitational wave discriminators to determine the legitimacy of an ArchEnemy identified glitch."

Note: We have combined these two comments.
4. In Sec. 4.1, the authors should provide more information on the 12 injections missed by the glitch-subtracted search that were otherwise found successfully by the original search. Particularly, how many of these had any degree of overlap with the scattered-light glitches?

5. Similarly, what is the primary reason that the glitch-subtracted search identified 10 additional binary signals? Two of these are displayed in Fig. 12, which helps. How many more of these signals were overlapping with such glitches? Also, did the glitch-subtraction aid their detection because the traditional chi-square values on those binary signals improved after the glitch subtraction?

Change:
We agree that this is useful information to provide. We have included the information on the overlap of newly-found and newly-missed injections with subtracted scattered-light glitches:

--
We have included the requested extra information within section 4.1, and the final paragraph on page 27. The text now reads:
"We compare the number of injections found by both searches but also look at the gravitational wave injections found by the original search and missed by the glitch-subtracted search and vice versa, this information can be seen in table~\ref{tab:found_missed_injs}. Considering signals found by the original search and missed by the glitch-subtracted search there are $3$ binary black hole injections with false-alarm rates in the original search ranging from $0.5 - 0.3$ per year, one of which had a glitch removed approximately $9$ seconds after the injection, there are $5$ newly-missed binary neutron star injections with false-alarm rates ranging from $0.5 - 0.056$ per year, two of the five binary neutron star injections had glitches removed within $60$ seconds of the injection, and there are $3$ newly-missed neutron star black hole injections with false-alarm rates ranging from $0.5 - 0.086$, one had glitches removed within $60$ seconds of the injection. The other newly-missed injections showed no scattered-light glitches within a $20$ second window for binary black hole injections and a $60$ second window for binary neutron star and neutron star black hole injections."

--
We look for nearby glitches removed from newly-found injections, and include the information in section 4.1 and pages 27 & 28. The paragraph now reads:
"The glitch-subtracted search identifies $10$ additional binary black hole injections, the most significant of which have false-alarm rates of 1 per $190.50$, 1 per $7633.84$ and 1 per $8643.73$ years. We illustrate the last of these in figure~\ref{fig:ae_found} (top). $5$ extra binary neutron star injections were found, with false-alarm rates from $0.5 - 0.19$ per year and $8$ neutron star black hole injections were found, where the false-alarm rate of the most significant is 1 per $9961.55$ years. This injection can also be seen in figure~\ref{fig:ae_found} (bottom). We find $6$ of the $10$ binary black hole injections have scattered-light glitches within a $20$ second window of the injection, $3$ of $5$ binary neutron star injections have scattered-light glitches within a $60$ second window of the injection and, $6$ of the $8$ neutron star black hole injections have scattered-light glitches within a $60$ second window of the injection. We provide more details about the newly-found and newly-missed injections in~\ref{sec:apdx_injections_table}"

--
We have included a new appendix containing three tables with the trigger information of the injections that were both newly-found and newly-missed along with our explanation as to why these injections were found or missed in the glitch-subtracted search. We include a more in-depth analysis as to why these injections were missed/found within the appendix. The text in the appendix reads:

"Here we have three tables which contains data on the newly-found and newly-missed injections for each injection set. The tables are separated into the values for the inverse false-alarm rate and ranking statistic found for each injection in both searches then the signal-to-noise ratio, $\chi^{2}$ and PSD variation values for each detector in both searches. The first table is the results of the binary black hole injection set, the second table is the binary neutron star injection set and the third is the neutron star black hole injection set. A horizontal dashed line separates newly-found and newly-missed injections, using a false-alarm rate threshold of 2 per year. There were 2 newly-found binary black hole injections which were not found at all by the original search and therefore they do not appear in the first table.

There have been 34 newly-found or newly-missed gravitational wave injections when subtracting scattered-light glitches, it is informative to understand how the gravitational wave search is influenced by the glitch subtraction to cause this outcome. The ranking statistic~\cite{Davies:2020tsx} represents the legitimacy of signal being astrophysical in origin and is partially computed using the re-weighted signal-to-noise ratio, which is itself computed using the initial signal-to-noise ratio alongside the various gravitational wave discriminators and the PSD variation measurement~\cite{Mozzon_2020}. We use the trigger information saved by the gravitational wave search to identify why injections that weren't found previously have been found post-glitch subtraction, and vice versa. 

As an example, we take the smallest false-alarm rate (1 per $8643.73$ years), newly-found, binary black hole injection, and look at the ranking statistic, signal-to-noise ratio, $\chi^{2}$ and, PSD variation measurements in both detectors and both searches -- these values can be found in~\ref{sec:apdx_injections_table}. This injection was originally seen with a false-alarm rate of 100 per year, far above our threshold, a very large increase in the ranking statistic from 13.29 to 27.01 is certainly responsible for the decreased false-alarm rate. There were no changes in the values measured by the LIGO-Livingston detector between searches which is expected as no scattered-light glitches were found within $512$ seconds of the injection. The LIGO-Hanford detector sees a small increase in the signal-to-noise ratio measured, from 7.98 to 8.22, a small increase in the $\chi^{2}$ value, from 2.32 to 2.48, and a very significant decrease in the PSD variation measurement, from 3.47 to 1.50. Using equation 18 of~\cite{Mozzon_2020}, we can calculate a re-weighted signal-to-noise ratio of $4.60$ for the original search and $5.67$ for the glitch-subtracted search, a significant increase in the signal-to-noise ratio. 

The decrease in the PSD variation is true for the three newly-found very low false-alarm rate injections, accompanied by the small changes in signal-to-noise ratio and increase in the $\chi^{2}$ measurement. For newly-found and newly-missed injections which lie close to the 2 per year false-alarm rate threshold there is no definitive reason as to why these injections changed state."

Additional changes:

We have included two new references:
"Glitches are caused by instrument behaviour or interactions between the instrument and the environment [17, 18]" - [18] is a reference to "Noise in the LIGO Livingston Gravitational Wave Observatory due to Trains"
"The ranking statistic [43] represents the legitimacy of signal being astrophysical in origin" - [43] is a reference to "Extending the PyCBC search for gravitational waves from compact binary mergers to a global network"
