General comments:

Overall this is a well-formulated, and well-presented research project.  It is very rare to see the noise mitigation or ``detchar'' community produce a physically motivated, mathematically sound, noise reduction technique *and* test its effectiveness on an actual astrophysical search pipeline.  One of those is always missing, usually the last one, the one that's most important.  I recommend this paper for publication, after the corrections below are made.

I would like to see all of the problems identified below corrected, but the most serious are (i) the repeated claims that glitches are ``non-Gaussian'', made here without supporting evidence, and (ii) the lack of a statement of the statistical significance of the final result, namely that glitch removal improves sensitivity.  Fixing both issues should be straight-forward.  Note that even in the event that upon analyzing their results they find their conclusion is not statistically significant, but I would *still* recommend publication, since even that observation should be documented.


Specific comments:

1. References.  I thank the authors for providing preprint information for all papers.  it is time consuming for them, but it makes finding the documents much easier, especially when away from campus.  however, the information provided is simply the arxiv document number which is incomplete.  I recognize them to be arxiv document numbers, so I didn't have any problems, but they could easily have been codes in some other database.  for example reference [1] is said to be simply "Preprint 1411.4547", with no database or location specified.  this is found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4547 which states to cite it as "arXiv:1411.4547 [gr-qc]".  I recommend the authors follow the citation instructions provided by arxiv.

Change:
The relevant preprint references have been updated to the correct 'cite as:' information as displayed on arXiv.

2. Abtract, "... we demonstrate an increase in the sensitive volume of the gravitational wave search for binary black hole signals ..." --> "... we demonstrate an increase in the sensitive volume of a gravitational wave search for binary black hole signals ...".  Note:  the 6 day analysis described here is not any of "the" published searches for gravitational waves from binary black holes, it is merely intended to be a representative example of such a thing.

Change:
We agree that the GW search we have performed is representative of a typical GW search and not an replication of a previously performed GW search, the text has been changed from "the" to "a" GW search.

3. Introduction, page 2, line 16.  as explained in reference [3] the first detection of gravitational waves was accomplished by the coherent waveburst pipeline.  this search pipeline is not included in the list of four example search pipelines that are cited.  since the discovery in reference [3] is specifically called out in this manuscript, I recommend adding a suitable reference for the search pipeline that achieved it.  I'm not familiar with which to recommend, perhaps there is information in the documentation, which a search engine led me to find at https://www.atlas.aei.uni-hannover.de/work/salemi/waveburst/doc/cwb/man/index.html.

Change:
The coherent waveburst pipeline reference, "https://inspirehep.net/literature/1802544", has been added for the burst search that found the first detection within 3 minutes of the gravitational wave event

Note: Two comments with regards to the referencing of glitches as non-Gaussian have been combined in this response.

4. Introduction, page 2, line 20.  the authors make the assertion that glitches are non-Gaussian.  has this been established?  clearly glitches are not the result of a stationary Gaussian process because their amplitudes are too great a departure from the mean, however has it been established that they are the result of a process that is *both* non-stationary *and* non-Gaussian?  said another way, has it been shown that a non-stationary, but still Gaussian, process cannot be constructed that adequately models glitch features in GW strain data?  references [13], [14], and [15] do not appear to support the claim of non-Gaussianity, but I have not read every sentence with care (it's nearly 200 pages of text, altogether, and the authors of this manuscript have not directed the reader to the appropriate location).  here's what my reading of those references found:

	- reference [13] on page 40 states "Over long stretches of LIGO-Virgo data, the noise is known to be non-stationary and non-Gaussian." but that claim is made without supporting documentation and without a supporting reference.  that text directs the reader to section 5 for supporting documentation, but section 5 is very careful never to claim the noise is non-Gaussian, only that it is non-stationary.  that claim of non-Gaussianity in reference [13] appears to be a fabrication, and cannot be used as supporting documentation for that same claim in this manuscript (perhaps that paper's referees were not as diligent as I am being).

	- reference [14] never makes the claim that the noise is non-Gaussian.  it does claim that a software system known as "iDQ" was used to search for and identify periods of time that are non-Gaussian, and that claim of non-Gaussianity is even in the title of the supporting reference for iDQ (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abab5f).  however, again, nowhere in that document is that claim justified other than to also cite this manuscript's reference [13], which as I have explained does not support that claim.  the authors of the iDQ paper appear to not be using the expression ``non-Gaussian'' as a well defined mathematical property of a stochastic process, but merely as a colloquial synonym for the generic term ``glitch'', perhaps because it makes it sound more science-y.  for example, just above their equation (5) they talk about formulating a "probability that Gaussian noise alone could have produced h", where what they mean to have said is "probability that stationary Gaussian noise alone could have produced h".  note above in their equation (1) where they have specified that n(t) is a *stationary* Gaussian noise process, a property that has been dropped from the analysis between there and equation (5) without explanation.  as I said, they appear to be using the expressions ``Gaussian'' and ``non-Gaussian'' as a synonyms for the generic terms ``non-glitch'' and ``glitch'', respectively, and are ignoring the mathematical meaning of the words.  in any case, there is nothing presented in that paper that establishes glitches to be non-Gaussian.

	- finally reference [15] does not contain any claim of non-Gaussianity.  like (most of) [13] it is careful only ever to differentiate between that which is both stationary and Gaussian, together, and that which is not, without saying which property, specifically, is not met.

without supporting documentation, the authors of this manuscript must reword this document to not make the claim that glitches are non-Gaussian.  the claim, specifically, should be that glitches are the result of a process that is not a stationary Gaussian process.

14. Also, here again in several places the authors are describing glitches as "non-Gaussianity".  the observation that the residuals are not consistent with the properties of the surrounding stationary Gaussian noise does not mean the glitch is the result of a non-Gaussian process, only that it's not the result of the same stationary Gaussian process that produced that other noise component.

Change:
We have avoided referring to glitches as non-Gaussianities:

Introduction:
"the data contains both non-stationary noise and non-Gaussian transient noise `glitches'."
to:
"the data contains both non-stationary noise and short duration `glitches' where noise power increases rapidly."

Section 3.4:
"This test is constructed so as to produce large values when the data contains a non-Gaussianity that is not well described by the template, but to follow a $\chi^2$ distribution if a non-Gaussianity that matches well to the template is present, or if no non-Gaussianity is present in the data."
to:
"This test is constructed so as to produce large values when the data contains short duration burst of power that is not well described by the template, but to follow a $\chi^2$ distribution if a glitch that matches well to the template is present, or if no burst of power is present in the data."

Section 3.4, next paragraph:
"Any non-Gaussianity that does not exhibit symmetric morphology should not fit with this deconstruction of the template, and should result in elevated $\chi_{r}^{2}$ values."
to:
"Any glitch that does not exhibit symmetric morphology should not fit with this deconstruction of the template, and should result in elevated $\chi_{r}^{2}$ values."

Section 5:
"such techniques offer a method for mitigating the effect that these non-Gaussianities will have on the search, maximizing the number of observations that can be made."
to:
"such techniques offer a method for mitigating the effect that these glitches will have on the search, maximizing the number of observations that can be made."

5. Introduction, page 2 line 42, and page 3 line 43.  the authors have repeatedly used (what I feel to be) the awkward phrase "surfaces in which scattered-light glitches originate from".  I'm pretty sure this is wrong, I think you can't both "in" and "from" something with only a single verb.  you have to pick one, like, "surfaces from which scattered-light glitches originate".

Change:
We acknowledge that the original wording "surfaces in which scattered-light glitches originate from" was presented awkwardly, and therefore, we have revised the phrase to "surfaces from which scattered-light glitches originate," as suggested.

6. Section 2, page 7, line 23, the total amplitude when the main beam and scattered light beam combine is said to be "Atot = A0 + Asc", but that is not true.  that can only be true for special values of the phase between them, which from equation (2) is not required to be 0.  I think this would be more clear if the amplitudes and phases were not separated, but instead if the amplitudes were treated as complex numbers.  for example if (1) was written

	A_sc = A_0 T \sqrt{2F / pi} \sqrt{f_sc} exp(i phi_sc)

with phi_sc defined as in (2), then it would be true that A_tot = A_0 + A_sc, as written.  please either correct the statements or change the mathematical definitions of the quantities so the statements are correct.

Change:
We thank the reviewer for noticing this inconsistency and providing a solution which we have now implemented into the paper, changing equation (1) to include the exponential term. We edit the following two sentences to define phi_sc and smoothly follow into equation (2): 
"where $A_{0}$ is the amplitude of the light resonating in a Fabry–Pérot cavity and $f_{sc}$ is the fraction of the optical power scattered back into the main beam.

The phase angle modulated by the displacement of the scattering optics is also defined as (2)"

to

"where $A_{0}$ is the amplitude of the light resonating in a Fabry–Pérot cavity, $f_{sc}$ is the fraction of the optical power scattered back into the main beam and $\phi_{sc}$ the phase angle modulated by the displacement of the scattering optics, defined as (2)"

7. Section 2, page 7, line 26, the logic is backwards here.  the claim is the strain is proportional to the scattered light phase, and therefore we write equation (3).  but equation (3) is not a proportionality relationship.  for small changes in phase, sin(phi0 + delta phi) \approx cos(phi0)*sin(delta phi) which *is* a proportionality relationship between strain and phase, but you get to that conclusion from equation (3), not the other way around.  Please reword.

Change:
We have reworded the statement regarding the proportionality relationship between the strain and scattered-light phase to include the approximation provided by the reviewer. The text previously read "The measured \gw{} strain is proportional to the phase noise and so the noise introduced by \scl{}, h_{sc}, can be expressed as" and now reads "The noise introduced by the \scl{}, h_{sc}, can be approximated through the relationship sin(phi0 + delta phi) \approx cos(phi0) * sin(delta phi) for small delta phi, and can be expressed as".

9. Section 3, page 12, line 42, the claim "The matched filter is the optimal method for detecting known waveforms in the data, when the data is stationary and Gaussian" is incomplete, and for the purposes of this paper, it is false.  This false claim is widely repeated in the GW literature, and it needs to stop.  The matched filter inner product is the optimal detection statistic *in the Neyman-Pearson sense* when searching for *a single known waveform* at *a single known time* in stationary Gaussian noise.  when searching for any member of a family of waveforms --- as is being done here --- it is *not* the optimal detection statistic.  it is, nevertheless, widely used because it has such a low computational cost, and because it's hoped to be probably good enough given that in the other special case it is, in fact, optimal, but that's not the same as being actually optimal.  perhaps one can argue it's "optimal" in the "what I can be bothered doing because it's probably good enough" sense, but that's not what people will assume this claim means, and it's not what the authors intend them to infer when making the claim.  the statistic known to extremize the detection efficiency at fixed false-alarm rate (the Neyman-Pearson criterion) is the likelihood ratio

P(data | signal) / P(data | noise)

for a single known waveform at a single known time in stationary Gaussian noise it can be shown that this ratio is monotonic in the matched filter SNR defined as the normalized noise-weighted inner product in the manuscript's equation (18), and therefore thresholding on SNR in that case is as good as thresholding on the likelihood ratio --- it's optimal.  if the waveform is not known, but it's still known that only one member of the family is present at a time, then P(data | signal) becomes

P(data | signal) = \int_{waveform family} P(data | specific waveform) d waveform

i.e., you need to marginalize the numerator of the likelihood ratio over choice of waveform.  the assumption that the matched filter SNR maximized over a template bank is still probably good enough is equivalent to assuming that P(data | specific waveform) is a strongly peaked function at the correct waveform, and so the marginalization integral can be approximated up to an unknown (and irrelevant) normalization factor by the value of the integrand at its peak.  it's not optimal, it's an approximation of what would be, and it's probably not even a good approximation for low amplitude signals, but it leads to an algorithm that has a low computational cost, and that ends up winning the argument.

Change:
We agree with the reviewer that the initial statement that the matched filter isn't the optimal method for detecting waveforms and therefore we have been more explicit in why matched filtering was chosen for this research project, following precedent set by the gravitational wave searched historically and the good approximation that matched filtering is to the likelihood ratio calculation. Therefore, we have replaced the statement:

"The matched filter is the optimal method for detecting known waveforms in the data, when the data is stationary and Gaussian, and is defined as~\cite{findchirp}."

with the following paragraph:

"To identify glitches with these values of the parameterization, we follow precedent set by the \gw{} search and apply matched filtering. While the likelihood ratio, which takes into account the probability of the data given the signal and noise, is the optimal detection statistic, we assume the matched filter is a good approximation to the likelihood ratio and is a low cost method of searching with a family of waveforms. The matched filter is defined as~\cite{findchirp}. "

10. Section 3.2, page 12, line 8, what is "search" referring to here?  this paragraph is describing the construction of a template bank via a stochastic algorithm that searches for and fills holes in a template bank.  *that* search is not linear in the number of templates.  that algorithm is probably cubic or worse in the final number of templates.  if what is meant is the search for glitches using the template bank is linear in the size of the bank, then please reword this to make that more clear.

Change:
To ensure the statement is more clear we have included explicit reference to search for scattered-light glitches with matched filtering, the statement previously read "The dominant cost of the search is matched filtering and is approximately linear to the number of templates" and has been changed to "The dominant cost of the search for \scl{} glitches is matched filtering and is approximately linear to the number of templates".

11. section 3.2, page 12, line 24.  a match of 1.0 indicates *parallel* waveforms, not identical waveforms.  equation (22) defines match in terms of normalized versions of the waveforms, so the match does not imply anything about the magnitude of either of the waveforms (a and b can be scalled up or down without changing the match between them).

Change:
We agree with the comments made by the reviewer and have included a footnote on page 12 stating the following "A match of 1.0 is only possible for normalized waveforms up to a constant scaling factor." to inform readers about the requirement of normalized waveforms to calculate a match of 1.0.

Change:
In an effort to make Figure 4 clearer for readers we have edited the caption to include "(black points)" when describing the templates to indicate that templates are represented by black points on a white background.

13. Section 3.4, page 14, equation (23) seems to not be a \chi^2 distributed R.V.  the (2n - 2) factor in the denominator appears to be the # of degrees of freedom, so this looks like (\chi^2 / DOF), i.e. a R.V. whose expectation value in noise is 1.  my understanding of what this is is reinforced by the form of equation (24), where clearly 1 is a special value.  that's a sensible quantity to compute, but it's not a \chi^2 distributed R.V.  the expectation value of a \chi^2 distributed random variable is equal to the number of degrees of freedom.  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution.  maybe changing the variable to \bar{\chi}^{2} and changing (23) to

\bar{chi}^{2} = \frac{\chi^{2}}{\text{DOF}} = \frac{n}{2 n - 2} ...

but leaving all the rest of the text unchanged is fine.  it's clearly some kind of \chi^2 statistic, that's not false, so calling it that isn't wrong.  what I mean is one only needs to change the symbol when used in mathematics, as the quantity from equation (23), one doesn't need to change the symbol in the text when talking about a \chi^2 statistic.

Change:
We agree with the reviewer that the chi^2 statistic we have formed is explicitly normalized by the number of degrees of freedom whereas the traditional form of the chi^2 statistic isn't. We have included the suggested additional equation within equation (23) to emphasize the chi^2 value we are calculating (now denoted chi_r^2 in the equation) is normalized by the number of degrees of freedom. We have also updated occurrences of chi^{2} to the chi_{r}^{2} variable where the text is explicitly calling for that calculated quantity.
"\chi_{r}^{2} = \frac{\chi^{2}}{\textrm{DOF}} = \frac{n}{2n - 2} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{n}} - \rho_{bin,i}\right)^2."

16. Section 4.1, Table 2, page 26.  we need to know what change in recovered injection count we should expect just from random chance.  we need to know if these changes in sensivity are statistically significant or not.  for example, the actual number recovered is a binomial-distributed random variable.  I can't do the analysis properly with the information available, you will have the information needed to do this properly, I can only guess, but here's how to proceed.  6200 injections were placed in the data, some of which will be found, at random, to meet the criterion "missed or found when glitches are present, but found or missed (the opposite) when glitches are removed".  which injections meet this criterion are uniformly distributed among the injections, and whether any individual injection meets this criterion is independent of which other injections have or haven't met it.  therefore, the number of injections for which the "found/missed" answer changes when the glitches are moved is, like the count of recovered injections itself, also a binomial-distributed random variable.  the maximum likely estimate for the probability that an injection meets this criterion is the actual observed rate at which it happens.  I don't know how many injections changed their answer, I can only see from table 2 that the net change is +7.  that's the difference between the number of additional found and the number of additional missed injections, not the total that change state.  but using that number, the estimate for the probability an injection is affected by the glitch removal is p = 7/6200 = 0.113%.  the variance in the number that meet the criterion is n * p * (1-p) = 6.99, so there +7 observed increase in recovered injections has a 38% uncertainty.  The claim that the sensitivity has gone up at all is something like a 3 sigma result.

however!!  as I said, that number is incorrect because it's using only the net change as the count.  you need to look to see what total number of injections changed their state, and re-do the analysis above using that number.  the 38% I obtained above is a lower bound on the uncertainty, so "3 sigma" is an upper bound on the confidence.  the correct answer is worse than this.

Change:
We thank the reviewer for the effort they have made to highlight the statistical significance of our result and have provided the analysis they wish to see. The paper now contains the information concerning the number of injections that have changed state, either newly missed or newly found, these are displayed clearly in table 3, page 27, section 4.1. With this information we have repeated the analysis made by the reviewer in their comment, the calculation has been included in Appendix B and the results of which - that the results we have found aren't statistically significant - have been included in section 4.1 alongside our opinion that the sensitivity gain isn't good enough to justify the use of time and resources on improving the significance of the results.

The sentence added into section 5:
"The statistical significance of the increase in sensitivity found for the binary black hole injection set has been evaluated in~\ref{sec:apdx_stat_sig} and is determined to be statistically insignificant, however, the resources and time required to increase the significance of these results isn't feasible. "

The statistical significance appendix calculation:
"We can calculate the statistical significance of our results for all 3 injection sets however, we only report sensitivity increases for the binary black hole injection set so we only perform the calculation for that injection set. For binary black hole injections there were $6200$ injected signals, $10$ additional injections were found in the glitch subtracted \gw{} search, $3$ additional injections were missed in our search, this gives us $13$ injections which have changed state. We calculate the probability that an injection has been affected by the glitch removal, $p = 13/6200 = 0.21\%$, we calculate the variance, $\textrm{variance} = n * p * (1 - p) = 12.97$, we take the square root to find the standard deviation, $\textrm{standard deviation} = \sqrt{12.97} = 3.60$, then we can divide the number of positively changed injections and divide by the standard deviation to calculate the number of standard deviations away from the mean we are, $\textrm{standard deviations} = (10 - 3)/\textrm{standard deviation} = 1.94$. A significance level of 5\% has a critical value of $1.96$, therefore our result is not statistically significant as our results is less than the 95\% confidence interval."

COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR(S)
The authors develop a chi-square discriminator for the scattered-light glitches in LIGO detectors and use it to test the improvement in performance of searches of compact binary coalescence signals. For this purpose they simulate those signals for varying source distances and compare the sensitivity volumes with and without the use of their method. They report observing very modest improvements and briefly discuss possible ways in which this method may be improved in the future. Scattered-light glitches are known to be a significant source of false-alarms in binary searches and have resulted in retractions of alerts.
For that reason, this work targets a worthy problem, which is expected to grow in its impact in the upcoming fourth observation run.
I recommend the work for publication provided the concerns below are addressed satisfactorily.

-----
Note: In the current version these are equations (23) & (24)
1. There is potential for ambiguity in the use of $\rho$ in equations (22) and (23). Is it true that the \rho in both equations is computed using the scattered-light template? If so, it would help to emphasize this aspect below (23), especially, because you cite a binary paper to motivate the construction of the reweighted SNR.

Change:
We agree that there is a potential for confusion, so the statement "where rho_{rw} represents the re-weighted signal-to-noise ratio of the \scl{} glitch template calculated using the signal-to-noise ratio, rho, and the chi^2 value of that template." has been included after equation (24) to explicitly define the variables.

2. In Sec. 3.5, how was the choice of 0.9s for the clustering window made? Ditto for the glitch frequency window size of 4Hz.

Change:
We have updated both statements to include more information on how they were chosen.
"using a window of 0.9 seconds" -> "using a window of half of the shortest duration template - 0.9 seconds"
"using a window size of $4$Hz" -> "using a window size of $4$Hz, a lower limit on the frequency separation of harmonic glitches,"

3. Figure 6: Lowering the reweighted-SNR threshold from 8 would identify more scattered-light glitches, but would also misidentify some of the binary signals as glitches based on only the chi^2 and SNR values shown here. However, this reweighted-SNR is not the only discriminator available to the binary signals, some of which may well separate from these glitches by way of other chi^2 test. I presume those tests do not benefit these injections. If so, this point should be clarified here.

Change:
The reviewer is correct that discriminators made available to gravitational wave signals would not be applicable here due to the scattered-light subtraction happening prior to running any gravitational wave searches. The subtraction will interfere with the gravitational wave signal power before any discriminator can be applied to prevent the subtraction from occurring. This is a potential future development for this project. We have included this reasoning in the discussion on page 31:
"Further integration with the \gw{} search and \gw{} discriminators could provide a technique for selectively subtracting \scl{} glitches where there is an increased possibility for a \scl{} glitch to have been misidentified on a \gw{} signal."

4. In Sec. 4.1, the authors should provide more information on the 12 injections missed by the glitch-subtracted search that were otherwise found successfully by the original search. Particularly, how many of these had any degree of overlap with the scattered-light glitches?

Change:
This is very useful information so we thank the reviewer for their comment, we have included the requested extra information in the final paragraph on page 27. The added information is as follows:
"Small changes in the PSD caused by removing noise can cause marginal injections to be missed, we can also look for \scl{} glitches found nearby the other newly-missed injections: one of the three newly-missed binary black hole injections had a glitch removed approximately $9$ seconds after the injection; one of the five binary neutron star injections had $10$ glitches removed from $28$ - $16$ seconds prior to the injection; one of the four neutron star black hole injections had glitches removed $52$ and $14$ seconds prior to the injection. The other newly-missed injections showed no \scl{} glitches within a $20$ second window for binary black hole injections and a $60$ second window for binary neutron star and neutron star black hole injections."
-----

#####

-----
5. Similarly, what is the primary reason that the glitch-subtracted search identified 10 additional binary signals? Two of these are displayed in Fig. 12, which helps. How many more of these signals were overlapping with such glitches? Also, did the glitch-subtraction aid their detection because the traditional chi-square values on those binary signals improved after the glitch subtraction?

Change:
With regards to the similar analysis of the previous point, this sentence was included on page 28.
"When looking for \scl{} glitches nearby to these newly-found injection we find 5 of the 10 binary black hole injections have \scl{} glitches within a 20 second window of the injection, 3 of 5 binary neutron star injections have \scl{} glitches within a 60 second window of the injection and, 7 of the 10 neutron star black hole injections had \scl{} glitches within a 60 second window of the injection."
 
The injections that were missed in the original gravitational wave search had no recorded chi-square values and therefore cannot be compared to the chi-square values when they were found in the glitch subtracted search. This makes it impossible to compare whether the newly found injections were discovered due to an improved chi-square value. We have mentioned within section 4.1 that the majority of the injections which changed state (newly found or newly missed) are marginal detections close to the false alarm rate threshold, therefore a small change in the PSD can cause a change in the false alarm rate for better or worse. To aid readers we have included a new table for the newly found and newly missed injections, along with their false alarm rate, in a newly added appendix.
